I am a hard-working college student currently in the 2nd year of my Bachelor's of Technology in the field of computer science. I currently have a CGPA of 9.47. I have a constant yearn for expanding my knowledge in the field, but have been limited by my family's financial condition. I would love to learn from esteemed universities such as those on coursera.
